# PhotonUnityTemplate

#Photon Unity Netowrk Example Code

An Example starting point of how to integrate Photon in your project. This is straight out of my current project, so a few refrences to other classes are here.

I'll be updating in coming days. This is not perfect or ideal design, has few dependencies on my current project. If you find it useful, contribute and share your experience.
Refer to others in need.

You're free to contribute and make it better. If you fork out and comb it up please create a pull request so I can review and merge with this.


Open to discussions create a ticket/issue or discussion thread here or send me an email at harrisbinkhurram at gmail.


Put these in your unity Project. Drop PhotonConnection.prefab in your loading scene, When you're ready connect,

Do the following:

StateMachine.MakeTransisition(typeof(StateInitialize));

make changes to files as required.
